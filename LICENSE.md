## License
Below is the text for the license for this repository and reasoning for why I chose it. The actual license text is just this text below.

### License Text
This is the license for the [https://github.com/devloop0/spectre-lang](https://github.com/devloop0/spectre-lang) project.
* If you modify the compiler or standard library, make it open source (under this same license, and include the text of this license with the project)
if you plan on re-distributing it. This is for the broadest definition of modify and re-distribute possible. Essentially, if you are asking yourself if 
you need to open source your changes, you should.
* Rephrasing the last point, if you change even a single bit of data in this repository, and you plan to re-distribute any resulting outputs, binaries, libraries,
or code, those changes must be made open source with this license. 
* If you write something in the Spectre programming language, link against or just use the Spectre standard library, or build an executable using Spectre, feel free
to just use the tooling and keep your code to yourself (as long as you didn't change any code in this repository to achieve those results).
* If you contribute something to this repository with this license, you accept that all of your code will fall under this same license. This means that if you
change the code and re-distribute any resulting outputs or code, then you need to open source it. The same holds for me.
* If you have any questions about this license, please contact me so that I can answer your questions and if need be, modify this license accordingly.

### Philosophy 
**Note:** This is not part of the license above, even though this is a subsection.

I realize that this license is very informal legally (to say the least). However, the reason I chose to spend the time to write is because of the following:

1. I have spent a lot working on this code; I don't know what that says about me (I definitely have a lot to learn), but I do know I value this code a lot.
2. I rarely like accepting things that I have no control over and I don't understand.

What this means is that unless I have fully read a license and understand exactly what it says, I will definitely not agree to use it. Perhaps at some point in the
future, I will read the text for the *GPL* licenses, but until then, this is what the license is going to be. I find it likely there might be something I'll
disagree with, so I don't want to commit to something I don't fully understand. All I know is that what I've written above is what I feel about the usage of my code.
In summary, even though I have read online that what I have written is similar to some variation of GPLv2 or GPLv3, until I have the time and the knowledge to have
read the license from a legal background, I do not feel comfortable changing it.

If you've read this far, you can probably tell that the minutia of legality is not my cup of tea. Just follow the rules outlined above in good faith and I'm sure that
there'll be no problems.
